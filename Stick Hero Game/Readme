This Readme file is about the code which implements a game named "STICK HERO" using JavaFX.
Contents
Initializable.java: Defines an Initializable interface that has an initialize() method. Used to initialize game entities.
Main.java: The main JavaFX application class that launches the game.
Piller.java: Defines a Piller class extending Rectangle to represent a pillar game element.



Scene1Controller.java: Controller code behind Scene1.fxml. Handles UI events and scene transitions.
Scene2Controller.java: Controller code behind Scene2.fxml. Main game logic for generating pillars, detecting hits, animations etc.
Scene3Controller.java: Controller code Scene3.fxml. Placeholder methods for restart and home menu actions.


Stick.java: Represents the stick entity that the player controls. Has methods for increasing/stopping growth.
In the Scene2Controller, I have done the the functionality related to the stick rotate, fall of ninja, and the transition of shifting to another screen.

Usage
The Main class launches the JavaFX application and loads the main UI. Character and Piller represent game entities that can be positioned on screen.

Scene1Controller loads the start menu and transitions to the game on play button click. Now the main game logic has been moved to Scene2Controller. It handles pillar generation, stick hit detection, point scoring and ninja character animations.


Major Features
•	Procedurally generated pillar platforms with gaps
•	Extendable stick growth through player input
•	Physics for stick rotation and falling
•	Collectible rewards with scoring
•	Animations and sounds
•	JUnit Testing is also available in the code files

Running the Game
1.	Make sure you have Java and JavaFX installed.
2.	Import the project into an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
3.	Add the JavaFX library to the project build path
4.	Run the Main.java class to launch the game.
5.	Use the mouse or touchscreen to play by stretching the stick and guiding the ninja. Refer to the rest of the README for project details.

Assume:
1.For increasing the length of stick the user click 2 times on the mouse and on 2th press hold on the mouse to grow the stick upward.If if lift up his fingure then stick fall horizontally.

Implementation of design pattern:
Here I have implemented Flyweight design pattern.In the code you provided, the NinjaImageFactory class is implementing the Flyweight pattern. The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects to share common state, thereby reducing memory usage or computational expenses.

Command:
1) Make your source folder to /2022341_2022596
   This is the root directory of all files , now simply you can run the file "Main.java" which is the main file
"Main.java" is in the folder : /2022341_2022596/src/main/java/com/example/javafx/Main.java 
Run : mvn exec java
